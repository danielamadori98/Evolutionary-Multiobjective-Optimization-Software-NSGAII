# Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) for ZD4 Problem

## Abstract

This report investigates the application of the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to solve the ZD4 problem using multiobjective evolutionary optimization. The study explores various combinations of parameters, specifically population size and mutation rate, to analyze their impact on algorithm convergence. The evaluation is based on the hypervolume metric, providing insights into the balance between exploration and exploitation in the optimization process.

## 1. Introduction

Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) play a crucial role in solving complex optimization problems with multiple conflicting objectives. This report focuses on the NSGA-II, a nondominated sorting-based MOEA that addresses computational complexity, nonelitism, and sharing parameter issues commonly associated with such algorithms.
The experiments are designed to systematically explore different combinations of population size and mutation rate. The ZD4 problem serves as the benchmark for evaluating the algorithm's performance. The key metric used for assessment is the hypervolume, providing a quantitative measure of the algorithm's ability to balance exploration and exploitation.
